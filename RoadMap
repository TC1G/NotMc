Story mode (this is just the story I written so far for my 2D 3D adventure game).
This file will serve to document my journey on this game!
Enjoy! I know it isn't practical but still.



Opening scene:
Our game begins with a little creature (it will probably be cute), the world is run with evil monsters and heroes that will defend this world (the heroes will be 3D)
Our creature (still didn't give it a name) wants to be a hero too, to help others but it can't cause it's tiny and it wasn't made to be a hero hence why it is 2D (all comon
folk will be 2D and lesser characters while the BIG BAD MONSTERS and Heroes will be 3D) The environment will be 3D too.

Intro: Will be a STAR WARS LIKE SCROLLER DOWN IN 2D 16 BIT TEXT EXPLAINING THE GAME. The creature will wake up wanting to train, as it trains it gets hungry and wants apples
it loves apples.
